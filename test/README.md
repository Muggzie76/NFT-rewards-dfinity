# Testing Documentation

## Overview
This document outlines the testing strategy and procedures for the Staking Dapp.

## Test Categories

### 1. Unit Tests
- **Balance Management Tests**: Verify balance thresholds, alerts, and status monitoring
- **Fee Management Tests**: Test dynamic fee calculation and network load monitoring
- **Batch Processing Tests**: Validate batch size limits and processing intervals

### 2. Integration Tests
- **Full Payout Process**: Test complete payout cycle with all components
- **Error Recovery**: Verify system behavior under error conditions

### 3. Performance Tests
- **Load Testing**: Verify system performance under maximum load
- **Stress Testing**: Test system stability under rapid consecutive operations

### 4. Security Tests
- **Access Control**: Verify admin function restrictions
- **Balance Protection**: Test minimum balance safeguards

## Test Environment Setup

1. Local Development:
```bash
# Start local replica
dfx start --clean --background

# Deploy test canisters
dfx deploy --network=local
```

2. Test Network:
```bash
# Deploy to test network
dfx deploy --network=ic
```

## Running Tests

### Manual Testing
```bash
# Run individual tests
dfx canister call test_payout test_balance_management
dfx canister call test_payout test_fee_management
# ... etc.

# Run all tests
./scripts/run_tests.sh
```

### Automated Testing
Tests are automatically run on:
- Every push to main branch
- Every pull request
- Daily scheduled runs

## Test Coverage Requirements

1. Unit Test Coverage: Minimum 90%
2. Integration Test Coverage: Minimum 80%
3. Critical Path Coverage: 100%
4. Error Handling Coverage: 100%

## Maintenance and Updates

1. Regular Updates:
   - Test cases should be reviewed monthly
   - Coverage requirements should be evaluated quarterly
   - Test documentation should be updated with each major release

2. Test Data Management:
   - Test data should be refreshed weekly
   - Backup test data before major updates
   - Clean up test data after each test run

3. Performance Monitoring:
   - Monitor test execution times
   - Track test coverage trends
   - Report significant deviations

## Emergency Procedures

1. Test Failure Response:
   - Document the failure
   - Assess impact
   - Create hotfix if critical
   - Schedule fix for non-critical issues

2. Environment Issues:
   - Maintain backup test environment
   - Document recovery procedures
   - Regular environment validation
