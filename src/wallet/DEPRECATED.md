# DEPRECATED DIRECTORY

This Motoko wallet implementation has been replaced by the Rust implementation in `src/wallet_rust`. 

Please use the Rust wallet implementation for all development and deployments. This directory is kept for reference only and will be removed in a future update.

## Migration

The Rust implementation (`src/wallet_rust`) provides:
- More comprehensive functionality
- Better performance
- Advanced NFT tracking
- Integration with registry interfaces
- More sophisticated data structures

## Next Steps

1. Use `src/wallet_rust` for all wallet-related development
2. Update all references to the Motoko wallet implementation
3. Run `/scripts/cleanup.sh` to clean up project files
